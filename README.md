# projectFunder
This project was a part of Database Course that I passed during my Bachelor, where I had to design a web application with the help of Jetty (backend) and Freemarker (frontend).
The database management system used in this project was DB2 on a server at University of Duisburg-Essen. It was accessed remotely through the program.
The Web Application is a Fund Raiser for proposed projects. A user can propose his project and others can choose to contribute to it or any other proposed ones.
